                        NCT U is the first sub-unit of NCT, created in 2016 by SM Entertainment. The group was the first to debut in 2016 with the double digital single “The 7th Sense” and “Without You”. Typically, in large projects such as NCT 2018 and NCT 2020, a majority of the tracks in the albums will be comprised of different NCT U units.  NCT U is known for having a very fluid and flexible musical style.

                    <p>
                        NCT U is a rotational unit. This means that there are no fixed members in the unit, and members will change based on each comeback/song based on who fits the concept the best. Sometimes, the members for a unit and the musical concept will be decided based on a member’s position in their normal unit, so NCT U may not have a balanced number of roles in the group at times.

            <div class="concepts">

                <p>
                    NCT U is known as being a unit whose concepts are always well executed due to the members who fit the concept the most participating. In the large-scale year projects such as NCT 2018 Empathy and NCT 2020 Resonance, several NCT U units are often heavily promoted throughout programs and shows due to the different concepts each unit projects. Examples of this include Make A Wish, with Middle-Eastern inspired styling, and 90s Love, an ode to 90s hip-hop and R & B pop.
