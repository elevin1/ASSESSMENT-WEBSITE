                    Typically, NCT does music promotions in sub-units such as NCT Dream, NCT 127, WayV and NCT U.  Along with the separate activities of each unit, the NCT group has combined twice to promote with full length albums, first with their 2018 release ‘NCT 2018 Empathy’ and then with their late 2020 two-part album ’NCT 2020 Resonance’, in parts 1 and 2.
